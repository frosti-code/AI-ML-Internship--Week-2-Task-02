ðŸ§  Task 2: End-to-End ML Pipeline for Customer Churn Prediction
ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Build a reusable and production-ready machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn using Scikit-learn's Pipeline API.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Telco Customer Churn Dataset
A publicly available dataset containing demographic, account, and usage details of telecom customers along with their churn status.

ðŸ”§ Steps Performed

Data Preprocessing with Pipelines

Handled missing values

Label encoding for binary categorical columns

One-hot encoding for multi-class categorical features

Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler

Combined all transformations into a single ColumnTransformer

Pipeline Construction

Built full ML pipeline using Scikit-learnâ€™s Pipeline API

Included both preprocessing and model training stages

Model Training

Trained two classifiers:

LogisticRegression

RandomForestClassifier

Hyperparameter Tuning

Used GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for both models

Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Model Export

Exported the final pipeline using joblib for production use

ðŸ§ª Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Numpy

Joblib

Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualizations)

ðŸ“ˆ Results

Achieved high accuracy and F1-score on the test set using Random Forest.

Exported model can be directly used to predict churn for new customer data.

ðŸš€ Skills Gained

End-to-end ML pipeline construction

Efficient preprocessing using Pipeline and ColumnTransformer

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

Exporting and deploying ML models

Working with real-world tabular data
